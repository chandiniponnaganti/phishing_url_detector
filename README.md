The Phishing URL Detector is a project designed to identify phishing URLs using machine learning techniques. Phishing attacks trick users into providing sensitive information by mimicking legitimate websites. 
This tool analyzes URL features to classify them as phishing or legitimate, helping users stay safe online.This repository contains the code, dataset, and instructions to set up and 
run the project locally, as well as push it to GitHub.
